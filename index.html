    <h3>About Me:</h3>

    <p>
        I'm Ajit Rai, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Engineering. With a strong passion for coding and technology, I'm always excited to dive into the world of programming and problem-solving. When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me on the cricket field, showcasing my love for the sport. The strategic thinking and teamwork that cricket demands resonate with my approach to both academics and coding challenges. I believe in constantly pushing my boundaries, be it in mastering new coding languages or honing my cricketing skills. With a blend of logical thinking, a competitive spirit, and a knack for innovation, I'm on a journey to explore the limitless possibilities that the tech world and the cricket pitch have to offer.</p>
